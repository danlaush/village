# It takes a village

How big was that project, really? How many people did it take to make it happen? Can I visualise those connections somehow?

I recently worked on a larger project, and it struck me how many people I worked with to make it happen. How long would the list of names be if it included EVERYONE who touched the project? It starts displayed as a field of name, an endless list. 

## How it works

When you click on a name (probably your own), it will highlight the people you worked with. That will draw your attention to the names you _don't_ recognise on the list. Click on one of those, and you'll see who they worked with.
